# R for Data Science - R4DS (2e)

This repository is where I explore all the contents of the classic book **R for Data Science** (R4DS).
I am starting my journey with R and data analysis, which is why I decided to create this repository as a learning diary.
Throughout the process, I make it a point to highlight the challenges I face and how I overcome them.
Whenever possible, I add my own insights and examples to enrich the material.
